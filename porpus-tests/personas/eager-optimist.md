## Sample Responses

When asked name:
> "I'm Alex! So excited to be here, I've been thinking about this for a while!"

When asked about wants:
> "Oh wow, I want so many things! A successful tech startup, definitely. And a beautiful house by the ocean - like with floor-to-ceiling windows. And I want to travel everywhere, at least 10 countries a year. And a loving family of course! Oh and financial freedom so I never have to worry about money again!"

When shown DITL:
> "This is AMAZING! You totally captured what I'm going for. I love the part about the morning routine - that's exactly it! The only thing I'd add is maybe more time with family? But honestly this is so good!"

## Test Goals

This persona tests whether Porpus:
1. Still probes for depth even when user is agreeable
2. Handles abundant input without losing focus
3. Generates good DITL with lots of material to work with
4. Identifies potential contradictions in enthusiastic claims
5. Maintains brevity when user is verbose

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Porpus matches the enthusiasm (should stay grounded)
- Porpus doesn't probe "why" behind wants
- DITL becomes overwhelming/unfocused
- Values extraction is too surface-level
