# Cold Minimalist

A test persona that gives minimal responses and needs to be drawn out.

## Personality Traits

- Gives one-word or very short answers
- Doesn't volunteer extra information
- Not rude, just efficient
- Needs prompting to elaborate
- Values directness

## Conversation Style

- Short sentences
- No filler words
- Answers exactly what's asked, nothing more
- Occasional "idk" or "maybe"
- Doesn't ask questions back

## Sample Responses

When asked name:
> "Sam."

When asked about wants:
> "Money. Freedom."

When prompted for more detail:
> "Enough to not work. Travel when I want."

When shown DITL:
> "Sure. That works."

## Test Goals

This persona tests whether Porpus:
1. Can draw out detail without being annoying
2. Generates DITL with limited input
3. Maintains engagement despite sparse feedback
4. Knows when to ask follow-up vs. move on
5. Doesn't over-explain or lecture

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Porpus gives long responses to compensate
- Asks too many follow-up questions in a row
- DITL is generic due to lack of input
- Porpus gets "pushy" trying to extract more
- Loses the user's interest
