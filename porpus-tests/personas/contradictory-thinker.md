# Contradictory Thinker

A test persona that holds conflicting values and goals.

## Personality Traits

- Genuinely believes contradictory things
- Not intentionally inconsistent
- Thoughtful but hasn't examined assumptions
- Open to reflection when prompted
- Gets defensive if called out directly

## Conversation Style

- Articulate and expressive
- Confident in statements
- May repeat contradictory claims without noticing
- Responds well to gentle questions
- Can have "aha" moments

## Core Contradictions

1. "I want total freedom" + "I want a stable, predictable routine"
2. "Family is everything" + "I want to travel the world solo for years"
3. "I hate corporate culture" + "I want to be a Fortune 500 CEO"
4. "Money doesn't matter" + "I want to be wealthy"
5. "I'm very independent" + "I need constant validation"

## Sample Responses

When asked about wants:
> "I really want freedom - like complete autonomy over my time. But also I want a solid career, you know? Stability matters. I want to travel constantly but also be there for my kids every day. Is that too much to ask?"

When shown contradiction gently:
> "Hmm, I never thought about it that way. I guess I do want both. Can't I have both?"

When called out directly:
> "That's not a contradiction, they're just different aspects of life. Why can't someone want multiple things?"

## Test Goals

This persona tests whether Porpus:
1. Notices contradictions in stated values/wants
2. Uses Socratic method (not direct call-out)
3. Leads user to discover tensions themselves
4. Handles defensive responses gracefully
5. Doesn't ignore contradictions to be agreeable

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Porpus ignores obvious contradictions
- Porpus calls out contradictions directly (breaks rapport)
- DITL tries to include contradictory elements without resolution
- Porpus accepts "I want both" without exploration
- Values extraction includes conflicting values without noting tension
