You are in PLANNING mode. Do not write code yet.

## Your Task
1. Read CLAUDE.md, PRD.json, progress.md, and guardrails.md
2. Analyze the current state of the codebase
3. Identify gaps between current state and PRD requirements
4. Create a prioritized implementation plan

## Output
Create or update `plan.md` with:

### Current State
- What exists in the codebase
- What tests pass/fail
- What features are complete vs incomplete

### Gap Analysis
For each feature in PRD.json:
- What's done
- What's missing
- What's blocked

### Prioritized TODO
Ordered list of specific, actionable tasks:
1. [Feature ID] Task description - verification method
2. [Feature ID] Task description - verification method
...

### Risks & Blockers
- Anything that might prevent completion
- Questions that need answering

## Rules
- Be specific and actionable
- Include verification method for each task
- Don't start implementing - just plan
- If requirements are unclear, note them as blockers
