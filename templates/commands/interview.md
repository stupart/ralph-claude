Read the PRD.json file and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything:

- Technical implementation details
- UI & UX decisions
- Edge cases and error handling
- Performance considerations
- Security concerns
- Tradeoffs and constraints
- How to verify each feature works

Make sure the questions are NOT obvious. Be very in-depth. Ask about things I might not have considered.

Continue interviewing me until you have enough detail to create a comprehensive spec. Ask 20-50 questions if needed.

When complete, update PRD.json with:
1. Refined descriptions
2. Detailed acceptance criteria for each feature
3. Any new features we identified

Also create a detailed spec file at specs/[feature-name].md for each major feature.
